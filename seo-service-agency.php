                    <p>In a word, SEO means Search Engine Optimization, where optimize a website according to search engine algorithm rules. Let’s divide the form SEO into two ‘SE’ and ‘O’ Here ‘SE’ refers to all ‘search engines’, like Google, Yahoo, Bing, Yandex, Baidu, AOL, and more. Basically, there are multiple search engines available in the world, and google is more popular among them. And ‘O’ refers to ‘Optimization’. This is the main part of SEO where an SEO Expert implements his/her strategy followed by all required search engine ranking factors guidelines. Approximately 200 (two hundred) ranking factors are followed in a fulfillment SEO package. Many have described the concept of SEO as looking similar in our daily lifestyle. In our daily life, we manage our daily habits – like exercise, food, sleep, entertainment, prayer, sports, etc. are all things we play for our good health and a fresh mind that can lead to a cure of long life. Similarly, SEO is a vital part of a website’s life that can manage and protect a business’s health, growth, and longevity. Without Search Engine Optimization, a website is going to be turned into a desert world where a business does not get any traffic. End of the day, the business revenue analytics will be zero. So, it is foolish to start an online business (website) without SEO in the 21st century.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-center">Aim of SEO</h2>
                    <p>The ultimate goal of the SEO project is to ensure a website’s SERPs (Search Engine Result Page) rank for a number of keywords/search queries in a specific location or globally. Everybody might ask the same question, what is the benefit of a website’s organic ranking? we also agree with this question. We also had a big question about that, but already we have got this answer. Just see the following statistics – 68% of online experiences begin with a search engine (BrightEdge) 53.3% of all website traffic comes from organic search (BrightEdge) 92.96% of global traffic comes from Google search, Google Images, and Google Maps ( Sparktoro ) SEO drives 100% + more traffic than organic social media (BrightEdge) So, we can tell strongly two sentences that, “If we get a SERPs rank, we get more traffic,  If we get more traffic, we get more sales.” So, it is clear, if we want to start a smart online business in this century then we must need a 100% Organic SEO optimized website that can maintain our search engine presence.</p>
