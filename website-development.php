                        <li><b>Servers</b> can be called your site’s hardware and software that send, process, and receive data requests. Servers work as a medium between database and client. The browser sends commands to the server to display certain data and the server brings out the data from the database and presents it to the client. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b>Domain:</b> At this stage, you have an IP address, but you also require a domain name that is easy to memorize yet attractive.
