                    <p>Digital Marketing is a marketing process of reaching the service or product to the exact targeted consumer via multiple digital platforms. Digital platforms can be – search engines, social media networks, email outreach, and different multiple electronic channels. Basically, digital marketing consists of 5 components – digital platform, digital device, digital data, digital technology & digital connection (internet, fiber-optic links, or microwave links). If we notice that radio is also a digital device that is broadcasted by microwave, so we can assume that the idea of the first successful digital marketing started with the radio broadcast. Then came the proliferation of digital marketing through television broadcasts. But in the current century, approximately 90% of digital marketing activities are executed through an internet connection and the remarkable platforms are a search engine, email outreach & social media. So, we will discuss internet-based digital marketing and our services also will be internet marketing. Let’s discuss the importance of digital marketing in this current century.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-center">Why Need Digital Marketing In Your Business?</h2>
                    <p>Just imagine, you have a billion-dollar investment with multiple products, but you have drastically failed to reach your product or service at the door of your potential consumer, and at the end of the day, your sell is zero. Definitely, your business will not be able to survive in the market. So, what’s the problem? You have multiple quality products, enough investment, but – Why have you failed to generate more sales?</p>
                    <p><b>The reason is the lack of marketing knowledge.</b></p><hr>
                    <p>In the modern era, the traditional offline marketing methods are declining day by day and the demand for online marketing, especially in internet marketing is increasing. A statistic says</p>
                    <ul class="web-list">
                        <li>More than 87% of consumers do their research online before buying a product.</li>
                        <li>93% of B2B marketers are actively using LinkedIn for their marketing purpose.</li>
                        <li>91% of B2C businesses report social media as being the most powerful content marketing tactic.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So, the morality is – digital marketing is compulsory for any scale of business. You must display your product or service online so that consumers can get an idea about it and get the product or service via online delivery or directly.</p>
